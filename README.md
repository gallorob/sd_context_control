# Context Levels in Image Generation: A Case Study for Video Game Assets

This repository contains the source code for the paper "The Importance of Context in Image Generation: A Case Study for Video Game Sprites".

## Installation

Install requirements:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to use
Generate images by running the `generator.py` script. Once completed, results can be automatically computed by running `evaluator.py`.

Images are saved under `results`. Questionnaire data is *not* included in the repository, so parts of the scripts for evaluation of questionnaire and figures generation will fail.
